Root calculator
===
By Mark Narain Enzinger

## Overview
---

This root claculator uses the [Shifting nth root algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_nth_root_algorithm) to calculate the square root of a number by calculating each of its decimal places one after the other. 

The calculator can calculate millions of digits of a square root. The result is saved into a txt file named output.txt.

Untill now, 32'805'552 digits have been computed with this program.

## Requirements
---

- Python 3.10
- matplotlib for time testing graph (root-test.py):

    ```sh
    $ pip install matplotlib
    ```
